## Variables Notes

Variable in programming is a named storage location that holds a value or data. This value can be change during the execution of a program, hence the term "Variable". Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data in computer programs, It is the basic building block.

```
let message; //Define the variable
message = "Hello" // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
```

## Variable naming

There are two limitation on variables in JavaScript:

1. The name must contain only letters, or the symbol **$** and **\_**.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

```
let userName;
let test123;
```

When the name contains multiple words,camelCase is used.
eg:`myVeryLongName`.

We can't use reserved keywords for naming an variables like <mark>let,var,const</mark>.
