# Data Types

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.

1. Number
2. BigInt
3. String
4. Boolean
5. null
6. undefined
7. Objects
8. Symbol

- `Number`: The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.There are many operations for numbers, e.g. \*,/,+,-.

- `BigInt`: BigInt is a new datatype that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

- `String`: A string is a series of characters like "John Doe". It can be written in single or double quotes.

- `Boolean`: It has two values: `true` and `false`. This type is commonly used to store yes/no.

- `null`: The special `null` value does not belong to any of the types described above. It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

- `undefined`: The special value `undefined` also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null. The meaning of `undefined` is value "value is not assigned".If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined.

- `Objects`: JavaScript objects are written with curly braces `{}`. Objects properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

- `Symbols`: The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
